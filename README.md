## Cricket Match

This is a simple exercise to model and implement a cricket game. My task is to build a standalone application adhering to the rules given, fulfilling the minimum requirements while complying with the given guidelines. A UI is not needed in this exercise. I ahve used Java  and a programming tool ( Eclipse). 


**Rules of the games are as follows:**

* Two teams, 6 players per team
* Everyone can ball and bat
* Runs can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
* Two ways to get out - caught and bowled
* Three balls per over, 5 overs per team
* Batting team is decided by a toss
* The first team to bat will be batting until all-out or overs finish
* The winning team will be the one with the highest score of the two


**Minimal requirements:**

* Play the game through the command line
* Naming the two teams through the command line
* No need to explicitly name players (hint: naming can be “player 1”, “player 2” ... )
* Hitting the ball is depicted by “p” key 
* Runs/ getting out should be random (hint: use a random number generator)
* After a match, a scoreboard should be shown, with the result 

### How to run the cprogram

1. Java code for cricket match and the runnable jar file is include this  folder.

2. Open command prompt in particular directory and run following command
			
        java -jar  Cricket_Match.jar
      
3. First **enter two team names**

4. Then enter **'t'** for toss

5. Selected team can ball/bat. For that enter **'b'** or **'w'**

6. Then match is started and for each ball, press **'p' key + 'Enter' key**.

7. Finally after each team played, **scoreboard is displayed in command prompt**.

8. When match is over **winning team is displayed**.
